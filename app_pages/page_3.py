        "using the median value. This is like using the average of all rows, "
        "but less sensitive to outliers, since a few rows show more than 5 "
        "siblings, which is unusual. This will prevent skewing the data "
        "towards having more siblings than the average would imply.\n"
        "The advantage is that all other values in the row that are not blank"
        " are still available.\n\n"

        "to the prediction, since LunchType could also be considered an "
