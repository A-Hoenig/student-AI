Interestingly the LunchType seems to have an influence 
over the students performance. This most likely can be explained in terms of
socio-economic context - parents who do not need to rely on free lunches most
likely can also afford additional support for their children (eg tutors). They 
might also be in a position to supervise their childrens education more if 
they are not having to work significant hours to maintain the family.
