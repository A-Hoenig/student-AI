That would allow the model to predict students in the fail, below average, average, above average and exeptional categories. - however accuracy is still a concearn, so alternative classification will be analysed using 3 bins. This will allow prediction of below average, average and above average performance and will probably achieve higher accuracy in prediction. <br>\n",
